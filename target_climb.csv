Originally done in seven pitches of excellent steep 5.10 face climbing. The route was later continued a few pitches higher by the late Zack Martin. Zack passed on before I could get any information about his extension, so I will only include the first seven pitches in this description. And hope that somebody will fill in the rest.   The route starts halfway between Ginger Cracks and Power Failure. Find the only big tree in sight and scurry up it till you can reach the 1st bolt.   P1: (130' 5.10) After the tree climb up through a right-facing corner and up left past bolts to a 2-bolt belay.   P2: (150' 5.10) Up and left following bolts to a 2-bolt belay.   P3: (40' 5.10) Climb up to the big ledge via crack and face.   P4: (120' 5.10+) Follow bolts through the roof via the right-facing corner then up and right to a 2-bolt belay.   P5: (80' 5.10+) Steep face past bolts to a 2-bolt belay.   P6: (80' 5.10+) Up the steep face to a 2-bolt belay.   P7: (160' 5.10+) Head up and left toward the top of the pillar.   P8,9,10: (???) This route is steep and sustained and can be cleanly rapped from the top of the seventh pitch.-15 draws and a small rack of stoppers and cams to 2""",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
