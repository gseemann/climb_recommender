Eases a bit on top to help with clipping the fixed anchor (2 bolts). -6 draws and something for the top.

Look for a crack system that diagonals up the north face. This is the route.Start by climbing up through face holds to get into the crack. Climb this for one long pitch until a horizontal crack traverse is seen. Set a belay. Then traverse 60 feet or so to the right on juggy holds. This is very airy, and the face drops below you. Finally for pitch 3, pick a variety of ways to the top. A large roof hangs above. There is a chimney on either side of the roof, the left being easier. Grunt through one of these. Otherwise, a beautiful \"lightning bolt\" crack heads to the right of the right chimney. This is supposed to be a 5.8 finger crack.Descent: You have two options. Either step across to the East summit of outer outlet and find the anchors that sit on the south side of the formation, or once at the top of the final pitch anchors traverse out right to a set of anchors and make two double rope rappels down the route Stainless Steel Shield. This route was first done in 1953 without climbing shoes, a short rope, and both upclimbing and downclimbing it. Very impressive if you ask me.-Standard Rack. Large and Small, bring it all.</td>\n",

       "105714734  This is one of the most classic 5.7 routes that I have ever done. Hike to the field north of Outer Outlet. The route is actually hard to pick out because it blends into the wall. Look for a crack system that diagonals up the north face. This is the route.Start by climbing up through face holds to get into the crack. Climb this for one long pitch until a horizontal crack traverse is seen. Set a belay. Then traverse 60 feet or so to the right on juggy holds. This is very airy, and the face drops below you. Finally for pitch 3, pick a variety of ways to the top. A large roof hangs above. There is a chimney on either side of the roof, the left being easier. Grunt through one of these. Otherwise, a beautiful \"lightning bolt\" crack heads to the right of the right chimney. This is supposed to be a 5.8 finger crack.Descent: You have two options. Either step across to the East summit of outer outlet and find the anchors that sit on the south side of the formation, or once at the top of the final pitch anchors traverse out right to a set of anchors and make two double rope rappels down the route Stainless Steel Shield. This route was first done in 1953 without climbing shoes, a short rope, and both upclimbing and downclimbing it. Very impressive if you ask me.-Standard Rack. Large and Small, bring it all.\n",

Climb up the chute with some big crystals to help you out, clipping bolts as you find them.  Once you get on 'top' the bolts end and you get to scramble on easy rock to the summit block.  Stand up & clip the bolt on the summit block, pull the final move(s) to the summit and anchors.   Note that the route is rather 'runout' and exposed getting to the last bolt, even though it's probably only 4th class.  Not your typical sport climb.

As you're hiking down to the base of The Fortress, you'll pass a narrow slot between a large boulder and the main wall with a large pine tree and ledge on the other side. Slipping through here will deposit you at the start of the route's second pitch, otherwise, continue hiking down another 100' or so to the actual start.   P1: 80ft. 5.9 Follow the bolts over a slightly bulgy start (not the bolt-protected roof to the left). A short 5.9 section yields easier climbing above. Use the pine tree on top for your belay anchor.   P2: 150ft. 5.9 Amid the myriad bolt lines that cruise upward from here, pick the second from the left. It will follow slightly reddish rock generally up and slightly left, then angle right and head straight to the top of the mini-tower. The climbing looks hard from below the tower, but the holds appear as you reach them. Belay from the 2-bolt anchor on top and relish one of the most fantastic positions in the Catalinas. Then rap down to the massive ramp, keeping a sharp eye for the 2-bolt anchor that lies at the base of the third pitch.    P3: 150ft. 5.9 Ponder your chosen pursuit of hobbies as you make the committing step over the void from the ramp to the main wall. Follow the bolts through the route's crux 5.9+ moves. Though mostly well-bolted, there's at least one lean stretch in the middle that will keep most leaders on their toes. Belay from the 2-bolt anchor. A dropped belay device from here will whistle down, strike an angled face, and lauch hundreds of feet into the trees. Really. After my partner did this I loaned him my spare, which he proceeded to almost drop again from the next pitch. Choose your routes and partners carefully.   P4: 100ft. 5.8 Follow a few more bolts over a short headwall and cruise up easy, unprotected 5th class to the 2-bolt anchor on top. Soak in the views, have some lunch, and argue over which pitch was the best.   Descent: Take the North Ridge 5th class scramble home, unless you have a second rope and want to risk interfering with other climbing parties and getting the rope stuck on rappel.-20 draws; the route is all bolts with double bolt anchors for each pitch.</td>\n",

Easy climbing through ledges to the base of the vertical crack, more than 180 ft, 5.9RP5,6- easy to link - hands, wide hands to the tree with slings. 200ft, 5.8.Note: The 2016 Sloan topo for this route is very inaccurate and is missing a belay between its 2nd and 3rd labeled stations (single bolt belay station at the top of p3 in the above description). Without this belay this would be a &gt;80m pitch.Descent: Rappel Arches terrace route to the left with two 60m ropes. This is probably the best option as these rappels are relatively straightforward and safe.  Four 2x60 m rope rappels to the ground: 1) from a tree to the left of the topout, 2) small tree on a ledge, 3) big tree visible from the top, 4) bolted anchor on face (small chance you have to use the intermediate with 60m ropes). 2x70m ropes allowed us to go straight from the top to the big tree with a small amount of downclimbing; there's a good intermediate bolted anchor between 3 and 4 that might allow rappelling with a single 70. As of 9/19 the tat on the big tree was baked and bringing a large (6 ft) length of rope or cord to replace it would be wise. Note: it might be possible to rappel the route or to the right of the route to the top of 1096 but the on-route stations were not equipped for this and comments below don't encourage this approach. -Started in the end of arches area, just before big arete/corner which face east-double from Black alien to Green camelot junior.

       "      <td>This route climbs through the center of the Wedge by combining existing pitches of moderate difficulty that lead to the easiest, yet spectacular exit out of the headwall.Climbed onsight under the threat of an incoming winter storm, the weather held and everything was Right as Rain.There are various other ways to reach the headwall pitch, some of which even offer better climbing, but I'll leave those for you to figure out. The route I describe here maintains the right trending nature of the line while taking advantage of comfortable belay ledges throughout the climb. It's also a good way to move your days supplies up into the wall and crag off these ledges.The route begins under Triton Tower while the rappels drop you to the east under the middle of the wall.See the Beta photos for reference.Pitch 1. From the ground beneath Triton Tower begin up the broken corner to the right. At the second tree, to your left is a large detached flake. Don't be the one to pull it off onto you and your partner. Find pro up and right then climb back left, only needing to tip toe across the top of the flake. It's not that bad, just not something you wanna dislodge. Stay in the corner or step left to clip the last two bolts of Sole Purpose (extend your rope well through here). Avoid using the large spike of rock wedged into the top of the corner. Skip the bolted anchor above the spike as well, and continue up the corner above for about 10'. The corner becomes a roof and arches out left (Dual Purpose). Leave the corner here by stepping out to the right and climb straight up to a bolt in a scabby grey face. The bolt protects the 10' 5.6 traverse to the right, into the Storm corner. Curse the grass while getting established, and then climb straight up the corner (crux) onto the left end of Not so Grassy Ledge. Belay here to remain in sight of your partner, or clip the bolt atop the corner as a directional and walk down and right 30', to the right most bolted anchor along Not so Grassy Ledge. 5.9 200'Pitch 2: This climbs the 3rd pitch of Supply Line. Off the far right end of Not so Grassy three routes begin off this anchor. The right most line of bolts is Thunder, left of that Supply Line P3, and Randall Handle left of that. Follow the bolted corner of Supply Line above. When the bolts end, stay low and traverse to the right onto the Command Center ledge. 5.8 90'Pitch 3: This pitch climbs the first pitch of P.O.W. and continues up and right a long ways, traversing easy ledge systems high across the wall. Straight above the middle of the Command Center are two pitons that protect getting into the finger crack. The crack fades into the face above, past an occasional bolt and looks to breach the small roof above out to the left. Over the roof is an anchor up and left (Black Castle belay), extend this double length and continue up the ramp to the right. Twenty feet up the ramp you'll encounter a pair of fat Metolius hangers on a red sloping ledge (Diamond P5 belay). Continue to the right and up onto the next ledge. Continue past the bolted anchor with no rap rings, and belay 10' further right at the bolted anchor/rappel station. You should be directly below the large white bird shit stain. 175' 5.9Pitch 4: If you intend to rappel to get down, leave what you want here at this anchor. A small cam to the left protects the belay as you get established on the ledge above the belay. Avoid trying to pro anything else up and left. The good rock and pro you want is tall up to the right. Pro these cracks well as they protect the crux move above the belay here. I dare say the crux may not be harder than 5.9, but I'll leave it at .10- for now. Follow up the crack to the traverse right, then back left after the only bolt on the pitch. In the corner above the bolt look for the finger crack that cuts left across the wall, this drops you onto the final belay ledge. 95' 5.10-Rappel back to the last belay ledge, and straight down the wall below you.-Singles to 3\".

       "      <td>This proud wall was one of the last large faces to be scaled.  Years after Half Dome and El Cap the striking south face of Watkins had still not been touched.  Even the all star cast on the first ascent team had difficulty surmounting this bigwall in the summer heat.     The route follows a surprising line of continuous cracks up the face and saves the best pitches for last.  Wonderful views and position abound on this route.  If not for the long approach and even longer descent this route would see much more traffic. The route gets almost all day sun so bring plenty of water even in moderate temps.  There is mandatory 5.9 free climbing and although much of it goes free in the 5.10 to 5.11 range the climbing can feel harder.  Pro is not always easy to find, cracks often a little dirty and grass filled and there is lots of slick rock.     Approach per the description on the main page and move to the far left edge of the large ledge system.     Pitch 1:  Climb up an easy angling right facing corner ending on a nice ledge.  Stop here or continue.  It is very easy to simulclimb the first couple of pitches.  5.5 250 ft    Pitch 2: Continue up slightly more difficult right facing corner for another 250 feet, clip the anchor and pendulum out right using small edges.  Clip an intermediate bolt and swing again right to the anchor.  Make a second rappel angling right again to gain a ledge.  Both rappels are about 115ft.  A 70m rope easily makes both.     Pitch 3: Climb up easy 5.5 terrain, pull a few 5.8 moves to reach a short and grassy but splitter 5.10 finger crack on the face to a ledge.  Move back left on ledge past an old quarter inch bolt and then go up face to belay at a tree.  Chopped bolted anchor can be seen.   Pitch 4:  Traverse out under roof and pull around corner on wedged blocks.  A little spooky but they seem solid.  Make a few difficult .10d moves with slick feet and then enjoy easier terrain to the anchor.  Belay at bolts.  140ft    Pitch 5:  Continue up the corner on sometimes slick rock and spotty pro.  Belay off pins at a stance.  5.10c 130ft   Pitch 6: Keep moving up the corner another 120 feet to a nice ledge with bolted anchor. 5.10c   Pitch 7: Many ways to go here but is the routefinding crux.  We went out far right then up easy but very runnout terrain and then worked back left.  We found no less than 3 bolted anchors on this face.     Pitch 8: From one of these anchors continue up the easiest path.  Appears there is a way at the far left in the corner but we ended up going out right again, pulling some steep moves surmounting a ledge and coming up on the right side of the ledge system.  Either way end up at the spacious Sheraton Watkins ledge.    Pitch 9:  A beautiful corner climbs straight off the ledge.  This sadly is part of the Tenaya Terror route.  The south face goes out a grassy diagonal crack to the left.  Climb gradually more difficult free moves to small cams and some fixed gear.  At a small ledge pull a few steep moves (or hook) straight up and then reach a series of fixed gear and bolts leading to some interesting things hanging on bolts.  Atop the bolt ladder pull one more hard free move on slick rock to gain the ledge and anchor.  150ft.  Aid Crux of route.   Pitch 10:  The one easy pitch on the route.  Move the belay up a 5.5 corner.  150ft   Pitch 11:  A hard move off the belay leads to easier ground and pro in a small corner.  Continue up 5.8 face to a nice ledge with a bolted belay.  90ft   Pitch 12:  Move up and right from the belay to a nice looking finger crack.  At its top clip a pin and move slightly left to a corner.  Climb this corner to another ledge with bolted belay.  130ft.   Pitch 13:  Take a deep breath and make mandatory 5.9R free moves straight above belay to an expanding tooth.  Put a large cam behind it, clip the pin, and move out left on a nice finger sized angling corner.  Continue left up the thinning crack past an old piton penji point until you are able to reach a bolt on the face just above the crack.  Clip bolt and pendulum left and down to a ledge.  Climb this right facing corner pulling a few 5.9 moves to another bolted belay on a ledge.  150ft    Pitch 14:  Climb up 5.9 moves in a corner to a ledge on the left.  From the ledge continue up a few sketchy bolts and either harder free moves or hook above another set of ledges.  Belay at a narrow ledge with bolts. 160ft   Pitch 15:  Yet again move left on the ledge and continue up a left angling crack.  The crack widens to wide hands but keep at least one finger sized piece to protect the top of the pitch.  Belay at stance on right with bolts.  150ft   Pitch 16:  If you are not exhausted you will enjoy this interesting chimney/slot.  The fist crack leads to a difficult bulge/flare.  Save at least one fist size piece for this section.  Belay at bolts. 150ft   Pitch 17:  An amazing crack if you have the energy at this point starting with thin hands to glory hands ends at a nice ledge with bolts in a spectacular position.   Pitch 18:  Worth the wait!  A clean hands/fist crack leads up and right to a corner.  Then move back left on bolts to an exposed arete overlooking the entire route.  Awesome!  Do a few more moves to bolts and top out.  Be careful of gear right off of the belay as the rope can pull it back deep into the crack.-Descent:  Total descent is about 7 miles unless you exit through Tuolumne.  From the last pitch continue up toward the summit directly north and away from the edge for about a half mile.  At this point change direct and angle NW.  You will eventually hit the Snow Creek trail.  Take it south (left) all the way back to the valley floor and then back out the Mirror lake trail. There is usually water in Snow Creek and it runs close to the trail.  Near a bridge on the trail is a good place to filter water before a series of endless switchbacks.  From the summit it is about 1.5 miles to reach the snow creek trail and then another 3.75 miles to the valley floor.-Cams   - Doubles from tiny to fist, optional extra hand size  - Offset cams 1-2 sets   Nuts   - 1 set  - 1 set of micro nuts   Iron   - 2 skyhooks  - 1-2 beaks  - 5-6 rivet hangers (small wire to thread fixed RURPs)   Rope   - 1 x 70m (no bail option)   OR  - 2 x 60m   Water!</td>\n",

Continue up the crack until it ends and slab climb up and right to a small ledge. Climb the splitter directly above which is formed by a flake on the left and a detached flake on the right. Exciting! Traverse left to a two bolt belay at a nice stance.   P2 - 130 ft - 5.0  Romp up the low angle crack passing an old two bolt belay on the left. Continue up 4th class terrain past bushes and some loose rock aiming for a very large flake. A gear belay can be setup on the left side of the flake.   This pitch can be linked with the next pitch if the follower is willing to simul-climb up to the old ¼ bolt belay.    P3 - 100 ft - 5.10b R  Gain the top of the large flake and walk or crawl across placing gear when possible. A final small cam goes in above the end of the flake which protects the next 20 feet of run-out face climbing. Step down and crimp across the face with care, aiming for bushes up and right. Midway through this section it is possible to get another small cam in a fragile flake. Once a small corner or bush is reached step right and belay at a horn/nipple. The place to end the pitch is not obvious, so build the belay as soon as possible. A short pitch.    P4 - 160 ft - 5.10b   Climb through the bushes above the last belay and enjoy a short section of finger crack. Clip one old bolt and angle up and left to a newer bolt. Traverse to the left on thin holds to gain a far off dike. One more bolt midway up the dike leads to a right facing corner. Follow this to the Fish Taco Flake. Undercling across this wide feature, clipping a high bolt before continuing around the right end of the flake. Belay at two bolts.   P5 - 200ft - 5.11a  Follow the pillar above the belay until it is possible to step left to a thin flake. Some suspect gear can go in here and it is best to traverse fairly soon to the corner on the left. Pull out your full bag of tricks. Stem, chimney and finesse your way up the corner. The left wall and arete offer constant surprises! The climbing eases by the halfway point which is marked by a single bolt that could be used for an optional belay. Continue up the corner almost to the end when you can step left out of the corner to a two bolt belay on a good ledge.  You can see another two bolt belay up and to the left. This is used for the Samurai Wind link-up   P6 - 85 ft - 5.11a/b  Step back to the right and continue up the corner for about 20 feet to a bolt on the left. The original route used this bolt to pendulum to the Big Kahuna crack on the right. For the Ronan free variation continue up, clip the next bolt and face climb past a very fragile crimp. Once this crimp breaks the move will be a letter grade or two harder.   Climb past more solid crimps and knobs and two more bolts until you can step down and right. A move around the corner to your right rewards you with a huge knob to stand on and a two bolt belay. This is a very short pitch.   P7 - 120ft - 5.11b/c  Wild arete laybacking and trickery right off the belay leads to a momentary reprieve as you work up and left. Move back right to a large incut knob which you can mantel. From here clip a high bolt and dyno to an enormous knob on the right. This move is amazing as you jump from a standing position without any handholds, but is very well protected.    Gather your wits and launch up a grainy finger crack that slowly widens to .75 camalots. Move right using fragile flakes and then weave around shrubbery to a two bolt belay on the right.    P8 - 175ft - 5.10++  Some initial tree climbing leads to a finger crack. Follow this up as it thins and goes over a small roof on amazing knobs. Relish in the plentiful footholds and finger locks as the crack seems to go on forever. Nuts work really well on this long pitch. Eventually the finger crack pinches out and you are rewarded with a gym like jug. Traverse right and then up on amazing knobs and scoops to a far off bolt. There are a few  options for pulling the next roof, and either way you will work back to the left to a bolted belay. I went straight up, unable to find the bolt marked in the topo on the left.   There are a ton of bolts at the end of this pitch. Belay at the two furthest left bolts. Mindblowing! One of my favorite pitches of a killer route.    P9 - 110 ft - 5.11b   A hard move off the belay gains a series of cool knobs. Cruxy friction moves force you left and then the bolt line will coax you back to the right. Long slings and some possible back cleaning of draws will help keep the rope drag at bay. A fun traverse to the left gains a pair of rail-road like dikes. Pinch, stem and savor the super cool climbing past plentiful bolts until you need to step right to the belay. A spectacular and very well protected pitch. No gear needed, belay at two bolts above a small roof. No gear required, 12+ bolts   P10 - 90 ft - 5.9 R  Work up the obvious dike past two bolts. This pitch is fairly easy but quite run-out. No gear is needed. Belay at two bolts below the blank crux pitch.   P11 - 150 ft - 5.12a  From the belay work up on poor smears and non-existent hand holds past 4 very closely spaced bolts. It is possible to A0 through the first 12 feet. Once the last bolt is reached you are through the crux and climb left to a small flake feature. Another bolt here protects a few 5.10 moves to the right wing tip of the seagull. A finger sized piece goes in here (the only pro you need for the pitch). Continue moving left past one more bolt to an obvious dike. This dike leans back to the right and you run it out past one more bolt to a two bolt belay. Trust your rubber!   P12 - 150 ft - 5.10d  Step down and traverse easily to a bolt. Continue traversing right, cruxy, for about 20 feet staying about level or slightly below the bolt. Once easier ground is reached head up to the left end of the swooping roof and place some much appreciated gear. Quest up the amazing knobby face aiming for the middle of the roof above. It is might be possible to get gear under the roof, depending on where you go over it. Romp up more amazing run-out scoops and jugs until you can see a few bolts on a blank wall above. Gain the obvious knob and clip a high bolt. Execute the crux mantel and work up and left past a two more bolts to a two bolt belay. A sweet pitch!   P13 - 150 ft - 5.9  Climb the bushy crack directly above the belay. Follow this up and left until it hits the large right facing corner.  Belay in an alcove above a large wedged chockstone on hand-sized gear. An awkward stance, but an easy pitch.   P14 - 200ft - 5.10d R  Quest up and right from the belay hoping that you can see the far off first bolt. From the good stance at the first bolt traverse about 15-20 to the right to gain a slabbier section of the wall. The next bolt is still about 20 feet above, but the climbing is much easier. I was unable to spot the next bolt until I climbed past it. If you cant see the bolt simply climb straight up to the lowest roof, which accepts gear. The third bolt is ~30 feet up at a 30 degree angle, to the right, from the second bolt.  In either case gain a small weakness in the first roof and locate a thin arching crack near some bushes. Climb this crack, utilizing a few wooden holds and make it up to the next feature. You should be able to spot the next bolt which protects a few slab moves to another roof which takes gear. Undercling across this roof, cruxy, until you can layback around the right side. From here move up and left without gaining too much elevation. Pull over a small roof and you should be able to see a three bolt belay above on a good ledge. A very long, wandery and involved pitch.    P15 - 100ft - 5.10a  Traverse across the big ledge until you can easily downclimb about 20 feet to gain another ledge. Continue left to the large corner system and climb up for another 30 feet. You can either layback up the pretty crack to the right, 5.10 or take the easier route up the low angle bushy crack to the left. In either case build a belay near the obvious tree/bush on the face above.    With a 70m rope this pitch can be linked with the next if you take the lower angle slabby crack on the left instead of the 5.10 layback.   P16 - 110ft - 5.11b   Move left from the tree belay to the main corner. Laybacking turns difficult quickly as the crack pinches down to nothing. Run it out a little to the first 1/4\" bolt and make sure to plug something before the next bolt. Relax a little as you clip a mix of new and old bolts, and then pull off some super thin laybacking. This pitch often climbs more like a slab than a crack since the corner is so featureless. Pass a final, newer bolt and hope the corner accepts gear before you blow it. Some easier climbing leads to a tree where you move left out of the corner and build a belay when convenient. .75\" - 1.5\" gear works for the anchor.   One of the topos offers an escape option on the left if 5.11 does not sound like the best way to end your day.-From the Charlotte Creek Camp hike 20 minutes until the first clearing where you can see the whole wall. Hike up the talus and slabs aiming for a large left facing corner in the middle of the base of the wall. From the top of the slabs traverse to the right across blocky terrain past the base of the large corner to a sandy slope at the lowest of three large trees. The route starts up the slab above, see beta photo. Two very large flakes are visible on Samurai Warrior, which are at the end of P2 and P4 (fish taco flake).   From the top of the last pitch gain the top of the dome with about 200ft of easy 3rd class. Go left (towards Charlotte Dome) and head into the trees and head down staying close the face of Bubbs Creek Wall. Eventually you will be forced closer to Charlotte Creek. Join up with the approach/descent for Charlotte Dome and head down to the main Bubbs Creek Trail. Descent should take 1 - 2 hours.-Single Green C3. Doubles from Red C3/Green Alien up to #2 camalot. Single #3 camalot. Optional 4 piece. Finger size and up nuts very useful.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This classic linkup allows an all-free ascent of one of the proudest sections of the Big Wall. It has a complex history with some sections first climbed in the 70s and others in the 90s. Jon Sykes's guidebook (Secrets of the Notch, 1st ed., 2001) describes the route and history quite well. Here I paraphrase his descriptions of pitches 5-11, because I have only done the first four, which are far and away the most popular. You'll find that the climbing on the first four is as good as on VMCDD or Lab Wall, making these some of Cannon's very best pitches. Sykes's book is a great resource, but unfortunately it's out of print. You might be able to find a copy at EMS or IME.   The route starts about 100' right of Labyrinth Wall Direct and 100' left of YMC Dike at a nice belay ledge on top of a 50' buttress. Locate a large roof about 100' off the deck - it's the roof that the first pitch of Lab Wall skirts the left edge of. If you are standing directly underneath the right edge of this roof, the start of Benedictus is up the jumbly buttress to your right. (Underneath the right side of this roof is a line of bolts belonging to the Lowther Memorial route. Benedictus is 20' further right.)   1. Climb off the ledge up and right to a hollow flake, continue to a very shallow left-facing corner, and clip a bolt. Layback up the corner past a pin; the short crux is about 5.11a if you're tall, a little harder if you're not. Step left to climb flakes and edges, 5.8 R, to a large ledge and a bolt anchor. 75'   2. The sick-looking finger crack splitting the clean face directly above you is your target. Climb up and slightly right through a bulge at maybe 5.9 and continue to the base of the finger crack. Layback, fingerlock, and crimp your way up this classic stretch of rock, clocking in at low-end 5.11. Gear belay at a stance underneath the roof, or link into pitch 3. 100'   3. Follow the roof leftward as it angles upward and turns into a chimney in a corner. Chimney or layback, whatever you do it's about 5.9. When the corner ends move right to a nice stance with a bolted belay. 40'   4. Climb up and slightly right to gain a left-trending ramp. Climb the ramp up to a shallow right-facing corner/flake feature. Clip a bolt and climb through a short crux, 5.11a with the right sequence. Belay at the nice ledge atop the flake. 75'   You can rappel from here with  a single 70m rope. From this point Benedictus Direct goes straight up the face on bolts, then climbs the overlap with two hook moves. The face goes free at 5.11d/5.12a to underneath the overlap, then the Insult to Injury variation (5.12a/b) traverses right. Another free variation goes left from the belay atop the pitch 4 flake and is described below. I can't comment on the state of the bolts or pins or how necky the R-rated sections are.   5. Climb up and left following a seam at 5.9R. Reach a stance, clip a bolt, continue left past a second bolt and a first crux at 5.11c. Join up with Lab Wall's fifth pitch, climb the 5.11 headwall to a small ledge and a two-bolt belay shared with Lab Wall. 100'   6. From this belay, Lab Wall goes up and left and When I Paint My Masterpiece goes right. Climb up and right to a horizontal crack, continue right past two pins at 5.10b. Climb through the overlap on large holds at 5.9+ R, and up the face to a two bolt belay at the next overlap. 120'   7. Traverse left then climb up to a crack below the overlap. Step right, clip a bolt, and undercling over the overlap past a second bolt, 5.11b. Move right to a stance and clip a third bolt, then climb the slab up and left past a fourth bolt at 5.9 R to join Walk on the Wild Side. Finish the pitch with a rightward 5.10 R traverse to a bolted belay at the grassy ledge. 100'   8. Instead of moving right to YMC Dike as you would for WOTWS, climb straight up the face at 5.9 R to a bolt, then step left at 5.10d to gain a right-leaning arch. Lab Wall Direct joins here. Climb the arch at 5.9 to a two-bolt belay. 80'   9. Climb left past a dowel, continue left at 5.9 and then turn up and right. Lab Wall Direct goes left here. Climb straight up the face, clipping three bolts, until you reach the shrubs. Somewhere in here is a 5.10d crux. 85'  According to Sykes you can rappel from here, though I don't know what is required for ropes.   10-11. Up a dirty slab to some bushes at around 5.6, then take the line of least resistance up nondescript shrubby licheny rock to the top. 300' or so-On the Big Wall, right of Labyrinth Wall Direct and left of YMC Dike. Starts atop the 50' buttress down and right of the 150-foot-wide roof that is 100' off the ground in the center of the Big Wall.-Single set of cams from very small to 3\" (blue BD), doubles of finger sizes  Nuts, including micros  14 quickdraws, heavy on the extendable draws</td>\n",

Look for the cleanest dihedral to the left of the tower that gets you to a big ledge covered in junipers, and that's probably the one we took.   P1 starts off with a little squeeze and then has some nice hands and fist climbing.   P2 starts behind the tower up the obvious OW.

       "      <td>The route was first attempted by early southern sierra slab masters Bob Kamps and Tom Higgins who completed the route up to the start of the traverse pitch in the late 1960’s. Higgins returned in 1973 with Mike Irwin. This route set a very high standard for face climbing style and difficulty in its day.    This route is really nice and one of the longest routes on Fairview. The route essentially follows the northwest nose of Fairview, climbing corners, flakes and cracks connected by runout face sections. An incredible full pitch face traverse right under the main roof allows escape to a bouldery crux face pitch and moderate climbing above to the U-shaped bowl and the summit.    All bolts on this route are excellent, recently replaced by the ASCA except the first one and one at the belay at the start of the traverse as of 2016.-P1: (5.10a R, 200’) Scramble up a large, low angle, left facing dihedral. Its dirty and has grass. As it steepens and splits, follow the thin lieback on the right straight up to a committing runout 5.10a on small knobs gains the first bolt. Climb right and up about 20 feet to another bolt, continue to an easy flake and the belay ledge on the left (bolt+pin+gear).    P2: (5.9+ R, 80’) Above the belay is a large roof that arches right, follow the crack just left, until it fades just left of and about 10 feet above the roof, good gear high, traverse left 5.9 to another crack, again with great pro. Traverse left again on small knobs (5.9+,R) to easier slab climbing and a belay ledge at a left facing corner (cams 0.5-2”). The Donny Reed guide shows a bolt on this pitch that was not there.    P3: (5.9, 220’) Follow the left facing corner above the belay to its end and face climb left (5.9) to a bolt. Face climb (5.9) above the bolt and continue face climbing straight up a seam/crack with 175’ of moderate 5.7/5.8 climbing. Belay just below the giant horizontal dike with a bolt and long sling on a flake. Done this way this pitch combines two of the original pitches.    P4: (5.9, 70’) Climb up to the dike and traverse right about 30 feet to a bolt. Slabby 5.9 steps lead past two more bolts and a large belay ledge below a giant right facing corner and the giant roof above (fixed nut and cams 0.5-2”). You could combine this and the next pitch but it’s a comfortable belay and rope drag is an issue.    P5: (5.9, 100’) Climb the beautiful right facing corner with some amazing liebacking, stemming, and underclinging and great gear as it arches right into a roof. Step down and right to a nice stance with an old belay bolt (old bolt, cams 0.5”-4”)    P6: (5.9+ R, 200’) On this traverse pitch, the leader and follower face multiple runnouts on short sections of 5.8/5.9 face and downclimbing, a couple times with some suspect gear behind loose flakes – an amazing, wild pitch of 5.9! From the belay with the old bolt, traverse right working up and right to gain the highest ledge below the roof (5.9), there is a great 3” cam here in the roof and a large flake to drop a sling on. From here, down climb right (5.8 face) to another series of ledges that are followed across, up and down short sections of 5.9, eventually reaching a bolt above a mantle onto a dike. A little past this, the roof ends in a giant dihedral, belay here at an amazing stance (cams 3”-4”).    P7: (5.8, 60’) Climb the large easy corner above until it is straight forward to exit left along another crack. Follow this and belay low (cams small to 1”) or at a belay ledge 10 feet higher with poor gear including a loose fixed pin.    P8: (5.10c, 220’) Hard face climbing above the ledge and a mantle gain the first bolt, harder crimps up and right reach the second bolt. Lieback up and left past a 5.8 move to reach meandering easy ledges, then an easy right facing dihedral to the U-shaped bowl ledge.    Move the belay – walk about 100 feet up and left on the ledge just past the start of easy scrambling.    P9 and P10 (5.8, 300’ total) Climb easy loose flakes (5.8) for about 70 feet to an easy left leaning ramp system. Continue to the summit 5.7.-Standard rack: nuts, cams doubles to 3”. A 4” cam is really handy for the belay at the end of the traverse pitch.  Standard Fairview walk-off descent.  You have to leave gear if you want to bail on this route.</td>\n",

Approach pitch- climb the loose corner to a good anchor in the notch on the south side of the tower (5.7R, 50ft).   Walk along the base of the NE face of the tower and locate the obvious corner/chimney system on the right side of the face (just look for the chalk).   Pitch 1- jam the hand crack through the bulge to an easy offwidth.  Continue up with a mix of face and hand jamming to a ledge in the chimney (5.10-, 130ft, gear needed for belay).   Pitch 2- work up the crack on the left side of the chimney system, pass the rappel anchor, and climb the excellent stem box (crux, RPs) escaping left to a ledge.  Continue to the anchor on the next ledge above (5.10, 120ft).   Pitch 3- traverse left, then climb straight up past a bolt to an anchor just below the summit (5.9, 50ft).   Pitch 4- climb up to the overhanging summit block and mantle onto the top (5.8+R).   Enjoy the views on the summit, scream at the people down at Big Bend, then reverse the mantle and downclimb to the anchor at the top of pitch 3.

       "105738359  This route is long, fun, reasonably safe, high, sustained and exposed. It's one of the best on the mountain with super solid rock...go climb it!   As you're hiking down to the base of The Fortress, you'll pass a narrow slot between a large boulder and the main wall with a large pine tree and ledge on the other side. Slipping through here will deposit you at the start of the route's second pitch, otherwise, continue hiking down another 100' or so to the actual start.   P1: 80ft. 5.9 Follow the bolts over a slightly bulgy start (not the bolt-protected roof to the left). A short 5.9 section yields easier climbing above. Use the pine tree on top for your belay anchor.   P2: 150ft. 5.9 Amid the myriad bolt lines that cruise upward from here, pick the second from the left. It will follow slightly reddish rock generally up and slightly left, then angle right and head straight to the top of the mini-tower. The climbing looks hard from below the tower, but the holds appear as you reach them. Belay from the 2-bolt anchor on top and relish one of the most fantastic positions in the Catalinas. Then rap down to the massive ramp, keeping a sharp eye for the 2-bolt anchor that lies at the base of the third pitch.    P3: 150ft. 5.9 Ponder your chosen pursuit of hobbies as you make the committing step over the void from the ramp to the main wall. Follow the bolts through the route's crux 5.9+ moves. Though mostly well-bolted, there's at least one lean stretch in the middle that will keep most leaders on their toes. Belay from the 2-bolt anchor. A dropped belay device from here will whistle down, strike an angled face, and lauch hundreds of feet into the trees. Really. After my partner did this I loaned him my spare, which he proceeded to almost drop again from the next pitch. Choose your routes and partners carefully.   P4: 100ft. 5.8 Follow a few more bolts over a short headwall and cruise up easy, unprotected 5th class to the 2-bolt anchor on top. Soak in the views, have some lunch, and argue over which pitch was the best.   Descent: Take the North Ridge 5th class scramble home, unless you have a second rope and want to risk interfering with other climbing parties and getting the rope stuck on rappel.-20 draws; the route is all bolts with double bolt anchors for each pitch.

       "106760957  P1. Two variations for start. We did right variation 5.9 which has interesting face moves. Belay at the tree. 120ft. 5.9P2. Started with broken ledges to hands/wide hands/fists crack.belay before bolted traverse. Gear anchor at p3 protection bolt, easy to link p1 + p2,, 120 ft. 5.7P3. Starts with short bolted traverse - transition to left thin crack.Hard well protected 10a move to a very thin crux with some fixed gear- more like face climbing 11a. Then a good finger crack 10c to a single belay bolt with good gear in the crack 120ft 11aP4. Start with 5.8 crack to the ledge where you have last pro for 5.9 move. From the ledge you should find positive hold and do several committing moves above your last gear. Falling here might have consequences but the farther from the ledge - the easier moves are. Easy climbing through ledges to the base of the vertical crack, more than 180 ft, 5.9RP5,6- easy to link - hands, wide hands to the tree with slings. 200ft, 5.8.Note: The 2016 Sloan topo for this route is very inaccurate and is missing a belay between its 2nd and 3rd labeled stations (single bolt belay station at the top of p3 in the above description). Without this belay this would be a >80m pitch.Descent: Rappel Arches terrace route to the left with two 60m ropes. This is probably the best option as these rappels are relatively straightforward and safe.  Four 2x60 m rope rappels to the ground: 1) from a tree to the left of the topout, 2) small tree on a ledge, 3) big tree visible from the top, 4) bolted anchor on face (small chance you have to use the intermediate with 60m ropes). 2x70m ropes allowed us to go straight from the top to the big tree with a small amount of downclimbing; there's a good intermediate bolted anchor between 3 and 4 that might allow rappelling with a single 70. As of 9/19 the tat on the big tree was baked and bringing a large (6 ft) length of rope or cord to replace it would be wise. Note: it might be possible to rappel the route or to the right of the route to the top of 1096 but the on-route stations were not equipped for this and comments below don't encourage this approach. -Started in the end of arches area, just before big arete/corner which face east-double from Black alien to Green camelot junior.

       "108702767  This route climbs through the center of the Wedge by combining existing pitches of moderate difficulty that lead to the easiest, yet spectacular exit out of the headwall.Climbed onsight under the threat of an incoming winter storm, the weather held and everything was Right as Rain.There are various other ways to reach the headwall pitch, some of which even offer better climbing, but I'll leave those for you to figure out. The route I describe here maintains the right trending nature of the line while taking advantage of comfortable belay ledges throughout the climb. It's also a good way to move your days supplies up into the wall and crag off these ledges.The route begins under Triton Tower while the rappels drop you to the east under the middle of the wall.See the Beta photos for reference.Pitch 1. From the ground beneath Triton Tower begin up the broken corner to the right. At the second tree, to your left is a large detached flake. Don't be the one to pull it off onto you and your partner. Find pro up and right then climb back left, only needing to tip toe across the top of the flake. It's not that bad, just not something you wanna dislodge. Stay in the corner or step left to clip the last two bolts of Sole Purpose (extend your rope well through here). Avoid using the large spike of rock wedged into the top of the corner. Skip the bolted anchor above the spike as well, and continue up the corner above for about 10'. The corner becomes a roof and arches out left (Dual Purpose). Leave the corner here by stepping out to the right and climb straight up to a bolt in a scabby grey face. The bolt protects the 10' 5.6 traverse to the right, into the Storm corner. Curse the grass while getting established, and then climb straight up the corner (crux) onto the left end of Not so Grassy Ledge. Belay here to remain in sight of your partner, or clip the bolt atop the corner as a directional and walk down and right 30', to the right most bolted anchor along Not so Grassy Ledge. 5.9 200'Pitch 2: This climbs the 3rd pitch of Supply Line. Off the far right end of Not so Grassy three routes begin off this anchor. The right most line of bolts is Thunder, left of that Supply Line P3, and Randall Handle left of that. Follow the bolted corner of Supply Line above. When the bolts end, stay low and traverse to the right onto the Command Center ledge. 5.8 90'Pitch 3: This pitch climbs the first pitch of P.O.W. and continues up and right a long ways, traversing easy ledge systems high across the wall. Straight above the middle of the Command Center are two pitons that protect getting into the finger crack. The crack fades into the face above, past an occasional bolt and looks to breach the small roof above out to the left. Over the roof is an anchor up and left (Black Castle belay), extend this double length and continue up the ramp to the right. Twenty feet up the ramp you'll encounter a pair of fat Metolius hangers on a red sloping ledge (Diamond P5 belay). Continue to the right and up onto the next ledge. Continue past the bolted anchor with no rap rings, and belay 10' further right at the bolted anchor/rappel station. You should be directly below the large white bird shit stain. 175' 5.9Pitch 4: If you intend to rappel to get down, leave what you want here at this anchor. A small cam to the left protects the belay as you get established on the ledge above the belay. Avoid trying to pro anything else up and left. The good rock and pro you want is tall up to the right. Pro these cracks well as they protect the crux move above the belay here. I dare say the crux may not be harder than 5.9, but I'll leave it at .10- for now. Follow up the crack to the traverse right, then back left after the only bolt on the pitch. In the corner above the bolt look for the finger crack that cuts left across the wall, this drops you onto the final belay ledge. 95' 5.10-Rappel back to the last belay ledge, and straight down the wall below you.-Singles to 3\".  Long slings.  Bolted belays.

       "110179339  This proud wall was one of the last large faces to be scaled.  Years after Half Dome and El Cap the striking south face of Watkins had still not been touched.  Even the all star cast on the first ascent team had difficulty surmounting this bigwall in the summer heat.     The route follows a surprising line of continuous cracks up the face and saves the best pitches for last.  Wonderful views and position abound on this route.  If not for the long approach and even longer descent this route would see much more traffic. The route gets almost all day sun so bring plenty of water even in moderate temps.  There is mandatory 5.9 free climbing and although much of it goes free in the 5.10 to 5.11 range the climbing can feel harder.  Pro is not always easy to find, cracks often a little dirty and grass filled and there is lots of slick rock.     Approach per the description on the main page and move to the far left edge of the large ledge system.     Pitch 1:  Climb up an easy angling right facing corner ending on a nice ledge.  Stop here or continue.  It is very easy to simulclimb the first couple of pitches.  5.5 250 ft    Pitch 2: Continue up slightly more difficult right facing corner for another 250 feet, clip the anchor and pendulum out right using small edges.  Clip an intermediate bolt and swing again right to the anchor.  Make a second rappel angling right again to gain a ledge.  Both rappels are about 115ft.  A 70m rope easily makes both.     Pitch 3: Climb up easy 5.5 terrain, pull a few 5.8 moves to reach a short and grassy but splitter 5.10 finger crack on the face to a ledge.  Move back left on ledge past an old quarter inch bolt and then go up face to belay at a tree.  Chopped bolted anchor can be seen.   Pitch 4:  Traverse out under roof and pull around corner on wedged blocks.  A little spooky but they seem solid.  Make a few difficult .10d moves with slick feet and then enjoy easier terrain to the anchor.  Belay at bolts.  140ft    Pitch 5:  Continue up the corner on sometimes slick rock and spotty pro.  Belay off pins at a stance.  5.10c 130ft   Pitch 6: Keep moving up the corner another 120 feet to a nice ledge with bolted anchor. 5.10c   Pitch 7: Many ways to go here but is the routefinding crux.  We went out far right then up easy but very runnout terrain and then worked back left.  We found no less than 3 bolted anchors on this face.     Pitch 8: From one of these anchors continue up the easiest path.  Appears there is a way at the far left in the corner but we ended up going out right again, pulling some steep moves surmounting a ledge and coming up on the right side of the ledge system.  Either way end up at the spacious Sheraton Watkins ledge.    Pitch 9:  A beautiful corner climbs straight off the ledge.  This sadly is part of the Tenaya Terror route.  The south face goes out a grassy diagonal crack to the left.  Climb gradually more difficult free moves to small cams and some fixed gear.  At a small ledge pull a few steep moves (or hook) straight up and then reach a series of fixed gear and bolts leading to some interesting things hanging on bolts.  Atop the bolt ladder pull one more hard free move on slick rock to gain the ledge and anchor.  150ft.  Aid Crux of route.   Pitch 10:  The one easy pitch on the route.  Move the belay up a 5.5 corner.  150ft   Pitch 11:  A hard move off the belay leads to easier ground and pro in a small corner.  Continue up 5.8 face to a nice ledge with a bolted belay.  90ft   Pitch 12:  Move up and right from the belay to a nice looking finger crack.  At its top clip a pin and move slightly left to a corner.  Climb this corner to another ledge with bolted belay.  130ft.   Pitch 13:  Take a deep breath and make mandatory 5.9R free moves straight above belay to an expanding tooth.  Put a large cam behind it, clip the pin, and move out left on a nice finger sized angling corner.  Continue left up the thinning crack past an old piton penji point until you are able to reach a bolt on the face just above the crack.  Clip bolt and pendulum left and down to a ledge.  Climb this right facing corner pulling a few 5.9 moves to another bolted belay on a ledge.  150ft    Pitch 14:  Climb up 5.9 moves in a corner to a ledge on the left.  From the ledge continue up a few sketchy bolts and either harder free moves or hook above another set of ledges.  Belay at a narrow ledge with bolts. 160ft   Pitch 15:  Yet again move left on the ledge and continue up a left angling crack.  The crack widens to wide hands but keep at least one finger sized piece to protect the top of the pitch.  Belay at stance on right with bolts.  150ft   Pitch 16:  If you are not exhausted you will enjoy this interesting chimney/slot.  The fist crack leads to a difficult bulge/flare.  Save at least one fist size piece for this section.  Belay at bolts. 150ft   Pitch 17:  An amazing crack if you have the energy at this point starting with thin hands to glory hands ends at a nice ledge with bolts in a spectacular position.   Pitch 18:  Worth the wait!  A clean hands/fist crack leads up and right to a corner.  Then move back left on bolts to an exposed arete overlooking the entire route.  Awesome!  Do a few more moves to bolts and top out.  Be careful of gear right off of the belay as the rope can pull it back deep into the crack.-Descent:  Total descent is about 7 miles unless you exit through Tuolumne.  From the last pitch continue up toward the summit directly north and away from the edge for about a half mile.  At this point change direct and angle NW.  You will eventually hit the Snow Creek trail.  Take it south (left) all the way back to the valley floor and then back out the Mirror lake trail. There is usually water in Snow Creek and it runs close to the trail.  Near a bridge on the trail is a good place to filter water before a series of endless switchbacks.  From the summit it is about 1.5 miles to reach the snow creek trail and then another 3.75 miles to the valley floor.-Cams   - Doubles from tiny to fist, optional extra hand size  - Offset cams 1-2 sets   Nuts   - 1 set  - 1 set of micro nuts   Iron   - 2 skyhooks  - 1-2 beaks  - 5-6 rivet hangers (small wire to thread fixed RURPs)   Rope   - 1 x 70m (no bail option)   OR  - 2 x 60m   Water!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "107049632  friction skills are all u need for this runout rock shoe friendly route.   PITCH 1: from block move up and right passing some flakes and 2bolts to bolted station. 5.8 70ft.

       "108446755  The Climb  P1 - climb the chimney to double hand cracks behind the bush or climb Yellow Tail (5.9+) through the roof to a bolted belay (100ft)  P2 - climb a bushy right-facing corner on the right side of the arete to a slabby ledge system.  We skipped the bolted anchors and belayed at the base of an east-facing wall (150ft).  P3 - climb the corner passing two knobs.  Sling the second knob at then move left to gain the east face via a dike.  Climb the knobs and cracks to a ledge with a bolted anchor (100ft).  P4 - climb up (trending right) past a roof to a hand and finger crack/flake (crux).  Continue right through some brokeness to the false summit and belay bolts.  From here, 20 feet of 5.5 will get you to the top (180ft).    The Descent  Walk off to the west is the best option.  The Pro  doubles to 3\" plus a 4\" piece, crux takes finger size cams

From the bolt anchor, lower or down climb into the gully to a nice, flat, belay block (no anchor there, but not needed). 8 boltsP2 - 5.10c - 60' - follow bolts angling left, then go up to the steep pillars of red rock to a belay station.  10 bolts.P3 - 5.10d - 60' - continue up the red stone staying just right of Dr. Hypocrite's Golden Rule, intersecting with that route at the last bolt on P3 to the shared anchor.  7 or 8 bolts.P4 - 5.7 - 100' - head right along a prominent ramp to the top of the pillar above DH Aid route and on the Forrest Van Meter Route (Dr. Hypocrite's goes left and more straight up from the belay at the start of this pitch),  10 bolts.P5 - 5.9 - 50' - head up and then slightly right off the spacious ledge. 6 bolts.P6 - 5.7 - 40' - continue up to the next station next to a small pine tree or keep going. 4 bolts.P7 - 5.7 - 50' - continue up to the next station or keep going.  5 bolts. P5-7 can easily be linked together (~18 draws needed).P8 - 5.10d - 100' - go up over a bulge of sorts, then go right below a headwall. Trend back left on nice stone and up to a belay on a stance,  13 bolts.P9 - 5.9 - 50' - press up the bulge and up to a belay on top of a buttress. From this belay, scramble up and right into a gully that leads to the top. 3 boltsP10 - Class 4 - 60' - head up to the right up a gully to the true summit and rappel anchor.  Descent - DO NOT RAPPEL THIS ROUTE - from the top, locate a bolted anchor on the west side and make a 60' rappel to the Recovery Wall Trail, and walk down. The big traverse on P4 makes rappelling the route very difficult!-This is just right of Revelation Route on Devil's Head Rock.-All bolts.

       "105957789  Toe The Line climbs the striking east arete of Tonnere Tower in two pitches. An aesthetic line, with varied moves and good protection.  It is comparable to Bihedral Arete in quality, but has a greater variety of moves.   Follow the east face approach on the Tonnere Tower page.  Traverse right on the dirt ledge until you're below the east arete. Start at a 2-bolt belay anchor on the ledge.  Be careful; this ledge is exposed.   P1: Climb a short dihedral right of a gully to the first bolt, and continue up to the arete. At the second bolt, step left, up, and back right (5.8); going straight up is much harder. Make a delicate step-up move (5.10b) at the third bolt. At the fifth bolt, swing onto the left side of the arete; do not go right. Clip the sixth bolt on the left side of the arete and make an airy high-step move (5.9) back onto the arete. Fun! Make some committing moves (5.9) past the 7th bolt. Continue up to a 2-bolt anchor on the left edge of the arete. 5.10b, 95', 9 bolts.   P2: Straight above the belay is the 5.11 headwall of Generous Donation; this is not the route.  Instead, angle up right, past three bolts, around the right side of the headwall (5.10a). Climb a slab and make a fun hand traverse right to an exposed arete (5.8). Climb the arete and a steep headwall above (5.9). Continue more easily to the anchor. 5.10a, 85', 11 bolts.   Descent: Rappel 85' down to the anchor atop the first pitch; angle the rappel a little to the left. From here, rappel 95' to the starting ledge.   Alternate descent: Rappel 95' to the anchor atop the first pitch of Tag Team; this is a straighter line down from the top.  Then rappel 65' to the start of Tag Team, and scramble back down to the start of Toe The Line.-The prominent arete on the east face of Tonnere Tower. Route #1 in the ?beta photo?. Follow the Sport Land approach.-P1: 2-bolt belay anchor at the start, then 9 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.  P2: 11 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.

       "109056990  P1 - 200+ ft - 5.8+  A few slab moves off the deck allow access to a left leaning ramp. Follow the leaning crack that goes over a small bulge about 75 feet up. Continue up the crack until it ends and slab climb up and right to a small ledge. Climb the splitter directly above which is formed by a flake on the left and a detached flake on the right. Exciting! Traverse left to a two bolt belay at a nice stance.   P2 - 130 ft - 5.0  Romp up the low angle crack passing an old two bolt belay on the left. Continue up 4th class terrain past bushes and some loose rock aiming for a very large flake. A gear belay can be setup on the left side of the flake.   This pitch can be linked with the next pitch if the follower is willing to simul-climb up to the old ¼ bolt belay.    P3 - 100 ft - 5.10b R  Gain the top of the large flake and walk or crawl across placing gear when possible. A final small cam goes in above the end of the flake which protects the next 20 feet of run-out face climbing. Step down and crimp across the face with care, aiming for bushes up and right. Midway through this section it is possible to get another small cam in a fragile flake. Once a small corner or bush is reached step right and belay at a horn/nipple. The place to end the pitch is not obvious, so build the belay as soon as possible. A short pitch.    P4 - 160 ft - 5.10b   Climb through the bushes above the last belay and enjoy a short section of finger crack. Clip one old bolt and angle up and left to a newer bolt. Traverse to the left on thin holds to gain a far off dike. One more bolt midway up the dike leads to a right facing corner. Follow this to the Fish Taco Flake. Undercling across this wide feature, clipping a high bolt before continuing around the right end of the flake. Belay at two bolts.   P5 - 200ft - 5.11a  Follow the pillar above the belay until it is possible to step left to a thin flake. Some suspect gear can go in here and it is best to traverse fairly soon to the corner on the left. Pull out your full bag of tricks. Stem, chimney and finesse your way up the corner. The left wall and arete offer constant surprises! The climbing eases by the halfway point which is marked by a single bolt that could be used for an optional belay. Continue up the corner almost to the end when you can step left out of the corner to a two bolt belay on a good ledge.  You can see another two bolt belay up and to the left. This is used for the Samurai Wind link-up   P6 - 85 ft - 5.11a/b  Step back to the right and continue up the corner for about 20 feet to a bolt on the left. The original route used this bolt to pendulum to the Big Kahuna crack on the right. For the Ronan free variation continue up, clip the next bolt and face climb past a very fragile crimp. Once this crimp breaks the move will be a letter grade or two harder.   Climb past more solid crimps and knobs and two more bolts until you can step down and right. A move around the corner to your right rewards you with a huge knob to stand on and a two bolt belay. This is a very short pitch.   P7 - 120ft - 5.11b/c  Wild arete laybacking and trickery right off the belay leads to a momentary reprieve as you work up and left. Move back right to a large incut knob which you can mantel. From here clip a high bolt and dyno to an enormous knob on the right. This move is amazing as you jump from a standing position without any handholds, but is very well protected.    Gather your wits and launch up a grainy finger crack that slowly widens to .75 camalots. Move right using fragile flakes and then weave around shrubbery to a two bolt belay on the right.    P8 - 175ft - 5.10++  Some initial tree climbing leads to a finger crack. Follow this up as it thins and goes over a small roof on amazing knobs. Relish in the plentiful footholds and finger locks as the crack seems to go on forever. Nuts work really well on this long pitch. Eventually the finger crack pinches out and you are rewarded with a gym like jug. Traverse right and then up on amazing knobs and scoops to a far off bolt. There are a few  options for pulling the next roof, and either way you will work back to the left to a bolted belay. I went straight up, unable to find the bolt marked in the topo on the left.   There are a ton of bolts at the end of this pitch. Belay at the two furthest left bolts. Mindblowing! One of my favorite pitches of a killer route.    P9 - 110 ft - 5.11b   A hard move off the belay gains a series of cool knobs. Cruxy friction moves force you left and then the bolt line will coax you back to the right. Long slings and some possible back cleaning of draws will help keep the rope drag at bay. A fun traverse to the left gains a pair of rail-road like dikes. Pinch, stem and savor the super cool climbing past plentiful bolts until you need to step right to the belay. A spectacular and very well protected pitch. No gear needed, belay at two bolts above a small roof. No gear required, 12+ bolts   P10 - 90 ft - 5.9 R  Work up the obvious dike past two bolts. This pitch is fairly easy but quite run-out. No gear is needed. Belay at two bolts below the blank crux pitch.   P11 - 150 ft - 5.12a  From the belay work up on poor smears and non-existent hand holds past 4 very closely spaced bolts. It is possible to A0 through the first 12 feet. Once the last bolt is reached you are through the crux and climb left to a small flake feature. Another bolt here protects a few 5.10 moves to the right wing tip of the seagull. A finger sized piece goes in here (the only pro you need for the pitch). Continue moving left past one more bolt to an obvious dike. This dike leans back to the right and you run it out past one more bolt to a two bolt belay. Trust your rubber!   P12 - 150 ft - 5.10d  Step down and traverse easily to a bolt. Continue traversing right, cruxy, for about 20 feet staying about level or slightly below the bolt. Once easier ground is reached head up to the left end of the swooping roof and place some much appreciated gear. Quest up the amazing knobby face aiming for the middle of the roof above. It is might be possible to get gear under the roof, depending on where you go over it. Romp up more amazing run-out scoops and jugs until you can see a few bolts on a blank wall above. Gain the obvious knob and clip a high bolt. Execute the crux mantel and work up and left past a two more bolts to a two bolt belay. A sweet pitch!   P13 - 150 ft - 5.9  Climb the bushy crack directly above the belay. Follow this up and left until it hits the large right facing corner.  Belay in an alcove above a large wedged chockstone on hand-sized gear. An awkward stance, but an easy pitch.   P14 - 200ft - 5.10d R  Quest up and right from the belay hoping that you can see the far off first bolt. From the good stance at the first bolt traverse about 15-20 to the right to gain a slabbier section of the wall. The next bolt is still about 20 feet above, but the climbing is much easier. I was unable to spot the next bolt until I climbed past it. If you cant see the bolt simply climb straight up to the lowest roof, which accepts gear. The third bolt is ~30 feet up at a 30 degree angle, to the right, from the second bolt.  In either case gain a small weakness in the first roof and locate a thin arching crack near some bushes. Climb this crack, utilizing a few wooden holds and make it up to the next feature. You should be able to spot the next bolt which protects a few slab moves to another roof which takes gear. Undercling across this roof, cruxy, until you can layback around the right side. From here move up and left without gaining too much elevation. Pull over a small roof and you should be able to see a three bolt belay above on a good ledge. A very long, wandery and involved pitch.    P15 - 100ft - 5.10a  Traverse across the big ledge until you can easily downclimb about 20 feet to gain another ledge. Continue left to the large corner system and climb up for another 30 feet. You can either layback up the pretty crack to the right, 5.10 or take the easier route up the low angle bushy crack to the left. In either case build a belay near the obvious tree/bush on the face above.    With a 70m rope this pitch can be linked with the next if you take the lower angle slabby crack on the left instead of the 5.10 layback.   P16 - 110ft - 5.11b   Move left from the tree belay to the main corner. Laybacking turns difficult quickly as the crack pinches down to nothing. Run it out a little to the first 1/4\" bolt and make sure to plug something before the next bolt. Relax a little as you clip a mix of new and old bolts, and then pull off some super thin laybacking. This pitch often climbs more like a slab than a crack since the corner is so featureless. Pass a final, newer bolt and hope the corner accepts gear before you blow it. Some easier climbing leads to a tree where you move left out of the corner and build a belay when convenient. .75\" - 1.5\" gear works for the anchor.   One of the topos offers an escape option on the left if 5.11 does not sound like the best way to end your day.-From the Charlotte Creek Camp hike 20 minutes until the first clearing where you can see the whole wall. Hike up the talus and slabs aiming for a large left facing corner in the middle of the base of the wall. From the top of the slabs traverse to the right across blocky terrain past the base of the large corner to a sandy slope at the lowest of three large trees. The route starts up the slab above, see beta photo. Two very large flakes are visible on Samurai Warrior, which are at the end of P2 and P4 (fish taco flake).   From the top of the last pitch gain the top of the dome with about 200ft of easy 3rd class. Go left (towards Charlotte Dome) and head into the trees and head down staying close the face of Bubbs Creek Wall. Eventually you will be forced closer to Charlotte Creek. Join up with the approach/descent for Charlotte Dome and head down to the main Bubbs Creek Trail. Descent should take 1 - 2 hours.-Single Green C3. Doubles from Red C3/Green Alien up to #2 camalot. Single #3 camalot. Optional 4 piece. Finger size and up nuts very useful.\n",
       "109379353  This classic linkup allows an all-free ascent of one of the proudest sections of the Big Wall. It has a complex history with some sections first climbed in the 70s and others in the 90s. Jon Sykes's guidebook (Secrets of the Notch, 1st ed., 2001) describes the route and history quite well. Here I paraphrase his descriptions of pitches 5-11, because I have only done the first four, which are far and away the most popular. You'll find that the climbing on the first four is as good as on VMCDD or Lab Wall, making these some of Cannon's very best pitches. Sykes's book is a great resource, but unfortunately it's out of print. You might be able to find a copy at EMS or IME.   The route starts about 100' right of Labyrinth Wall Direct and 100' left of YMC Dike at a nice belay ledge on top of a 50' buttress. Locate a large roof about 100' off the deck - it's the roof that the first pitch of Lab Wall skirts the left edge of. If you are standing directly underneath the right edge of this roof, the start of Benedictus is up the jumbly buttress to your right. (Underneath the right side of this roof is a line of bolts belonging to the Lowther Memorial route. Benedictus is 20' further right.)   1. Climb off the ledge up and right to a hollow flake, continue to a very shallow left-facing corner, and clip a bolt. Layback up the corner past a pin; the short crux is about 5.11a if you're tall, a little harder if you're not. Step left to climb flakes and edges, 5.8 R, to a large ledge and a bolt anchor. 75'   2. The sick-looking finger crack splitting the clean face directly above you is your target. Climb up and slightly right through a bulge at maybe 5.9 and continue to the base of the finger crack. Layback, fingerlock, and crimp your way up this classic stretch of rock, clocking in at low-end 5.11. Gear belay at a stance underneath the roof, or link into pitch 3. 100'   3. Follow the roof leftward as it angles upward and turns into a chimney in a corner. Chimney or layback, whatever you do it's about 5.9. When the corner ends move right to a nice stance with a bolted belay. 40'   4. Climb up and slightly right to gain a left-trending ramp. Climb the ramp up to a shallow right-facing corner/flake feature. Clip a bolt and climb through a short crux, 5.11a with the right sequence. Belay at the nice ledge atop the flake. 75'   You can rappel from here with  a single 70m rope. From this point Benedictus Direct goes straight up the face on bolts, then climbs the overlap with two hook moves. The face goes free at 5.11d/5.12a to underneath the overlap, then the Insult to Injury variation (5.12a/b) traverses right. Another free variation goes left from the belay atop the pitch 4 flake and is described below. I can't comment on the state of the bolts or pins or how necky the R-rated sections are.   5. Climb up and left following a seam at 5.9R. Reach a stance, clip a bolt, continue left past a second bolt and a first crux at 5.11c. Join up with Lab Wall's fifth pitch, climb the 5.11 headwall to a small ledge and a two-bolt belay shared with Lab Wall. 100'   6. From this belay, Lab Wall goes up and left and When I Paint My Masterpiece goes right. Climb up and right to a horizontal crack, continue right past two pins at 5.10b. Climb through the overlap on large holds at 5.9+ R, and up the face to a two bolt belay at the next overlap. 120'   7. Traverse left then climb up to a crack below the overlap. Step right, clip a bolt, and undercling over the overlap past a second bolt, 5.11b. Move right to a stance and clip a third bolt, then climb the slab up and left past a fourth bolt at 5.9 R to join Walk on the Wild Side. Finish the pitch with a rightward 5.10 R traverse to a bolted belay at the grassy ledge. 100'   8. Instead of moving right to YMC Dike as you would for WOTWS, climb straight up the face at 5.9 R to a bolt, then step left at 5.10d to gain a right-leaning arch. Lab Wall Direct joins here. Climb the arch at 5.9 to a two-bolt belay. 80'   9. Climb left past a dowel, continue left at 5.9 and then turn up and right. Lab Wall Direct goes left here. Climb straight up the face, clipping three bolts, until you reach the shrubs. Somewhere in here is a 5.10d crux. 85'  According to Sykes you can rappel from here, though I don't know what is required for ropes.   10-11. Up a dirty slab to some bushes at around 5.6, then take the line of least resistance up nondescript shrubby licheny rock to the top. 300' or so-On the Big Wall, right of Labyrinth Wall Direct and left of YMC Dike. Starts atop the 50' buttress down and right of the 150-foot-wide roof that is 100' off the ground in the center of the Big Wall.-Single set of cams from very small to 3\" (blue BD), doubles of finger

       "109979571  Bobble Head Tower has an OK route with some fun sections and some dirty sections. The route starts several dihedrals to the climber's left of the tower. Look for the cleanest dihedral to the left of the tower that gets you to a big ledge covered in junipers, and that's probably the one we took.   P1 starts off with a little squeeze and then has some nice hands and fist climbing.   P2 starts behind the tower up the obvious OW. The crux is pretty junky rock, but it quickly gets better and is pretty feature to the top.-Hands and up.  For P2 you'll want some of the bigger cams.  A full 60 m rap gets you to the ground.-Bobble Head Tower is across from Butt Crack Tower.  It's kind of hard to pick out, but it's a top heavy tower with a crack right down its middle, splitting it in two.

       "107752402  The route was first attempted by early southern sierra slab masters Bob Kamps and Tom Higgins who completed the route up to the start of the traverse pitch in the late 1960’s. Higgins returned in 1973 with Mike Irwin. This route set a very high standard for face climbing style and difficulty in its day.    This route is really nice and one of the longest routes on Fairview. The route essentially follows the northwest nose of Fairview, climbing corners, flakes and cracks connected by runout face sections. An incredible full pitch face traverse right under the main roof allows escape to a bouldery crux face pitch and moderate climbing above to the U-shaped bowl and the summit.    All bolts on this route are excellent, recently replaced by the ASCA except the first one and one at the belay at the start of the traverse as of 2016.-P1: (5.10a R, 200’) Scramble up a large, low angle, left facing dihedral. Its dirty and has grass. As it steepens and splits, follow the thin lieback on the right straight up to a committing runout 5.10a on small knobs gains the first bolt. Climb right and up about 20 feet to another bolt, continue to an easy flake and the belay ledge on the left (bolt+pin+gear).    P2: (5.9+ R, 80’) Above the belay is a large roof that arches right, follow the crack just left, until it fades just left of and about 10 feet above the roof, good gear high, traverse left 5.9 to another crack, again with great pro. Traverse left again on small knobs (5.9+,R) to easier slab climbing and a belay ledge at a left facing corner (cams 0.5-2”). The Donny Reed guide shows a bolt on this pitch that was not there.    P3: (5.9, 220’) Follow the left facing corner above the belay to its end and face climb left (5.9) to a bolt. Face climb (5.9) above the bolt and continue face climbing straight up a seam/crack with 175’ of moderate 5.7/5.8 climbing. Belay just below the giant horizontal dike with a bolt and long sling on a flake. Done this way this pitch combines two of the original pitches.    P4: (5.9, 70’) Climb up to the dike and traverse right about 30 feet to a bolt. Slabby 5.9 steps lead past two more bolts and a large belay ledge below a giant right facing corner and the giant roof above (fixed nut and cams 0.5-2”). You could combine this and the next pitch but it’s a comfortable belay and rope drag is an issue.    P5: (5.9, 100’) Climb the beautiful right facing corner with some amazing liebacking, stemming, and underclinging and great gear as it arches right into a roof. Step down and right to a nice stance with an old belay bolt (old bolt, cams 0.5”-4”)    P6: (5.9+ R, 200’) On this traverse pitch, the leader and follower face multiple runnouts on short sections of 5.8/5.9 face and downclimbing, a couple times with some suspect gear behind loose flakes – an amazing, wild pitch of 5.9! From the belay with the old bolt, traverse right working up and right to gain the highest ledge below the roof (5.9), there is a great 3” cam here in the roof and a large flake to drop a sling on. From here, down climb right (5.8 face) to another series of ledges that are followed across, up and down short sections of 5.9, eventually reaching a bolt above a mantle onto a dike. A little past this, the roof ends in a giant dihedral, belay here at an amazing stance (cams 3”-4”).    P7: (5.8, 60’) Climb the large easy corner above until it is straight forward to exit left along another crack. Follow this and belay low (cams small to 1”) or at a belay ledge 10 feet higher with poor gear including a loose fixed pin.    P8: (5.10c, 220’) Hard face climbing above the ledge and a mantle gain the first bolt, harder crimps up and right reach the second bolt. Lieback up and left past a 5.8 move to reach meandering easy ledges, then an easy right facing dihedral to the U-shaped bowl ledge.    Move the belay – walk about 100 feet up and left on the ledge just past the start of easy scrambling.    P9 and P10 (5.8, 300’ total) Climb easy loose flakes (5.8) for about 70 feet to an easy left leaning ramp system. Continue to the summit 5.7.-Standard rack: nuts, cams doubles to 3”. A 4” cam is really handy for the belay at the end of the traverse pitch.  Standard Fairview walk-off descent.  You have to leave gear if you want to bail on this route.

       "105717637  This excellent route is on the E side of the tower.  The approach trail leads to the W face, so a short approach pitch must be climbed to get to the other side of the tower.    Approach pitch- climb the loose corner to a good anchor in the notch on the south side of the tower (5.7R, 50ft).   Walk along the base of the NE face of the tower and locate the obvious corner/chimney system on the right side of the face (just look for the chalk).   Pitch 1- jam the hand crack through the bulge to an easy offwidth.  Continue up with a mix of face and hand jamming to a ledge in the chimney (5.10-, 130ft, gear needed for belay).   Pitch 2- work up the crack on the left side of the chimney system, pass the rappel anchor, and climb the excellent stem box (crux, RPs) escaping left to a ledge.  Continue to the anchor on the next ledge above (5.10, 120ft).   Pitch 3- traverse left, then climb straight up past a bolt to an anchor just below the summit (5.9, 50ft).   Pitch 4- climb up to the overhanging summit block and mantle onto the top (5.8+R).   Enjoy the views on the summit, scream at the people down at Big Bend, then reverse the mantle and downclimb to the anchor at the top of pitch 3.  Belay your partner as he/she leads the last pitch and downclimbs back to the anchor.  The guide said something about running a TR over the top but I didn't see how that could be done.   DESCENT: Rap 1- 50' rappel to the anchors atop pitch 2.  Rap 2- 75' rappel to the anchors in the middle of pitch 2.  Rap 3- 150' rappel to the ground.  Walk to the anchors atop the approach pitch and rappel to your packs at the base of the SW face. Requires a two rope rappel.-2 sets of cams to #3 camalot, a #4 friend or camalot, and RPs for the crux.
